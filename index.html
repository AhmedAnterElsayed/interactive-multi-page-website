  <h1>Educator • Data Science & AI Enthusiast</h1>
  <p>
    I build educational experiences that combine clear thinking,
    strong fundamentals, and modern technology.
  </p>
  <section class="content-block">
  <h2>Education with Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    I view education as a process of building understanding, not collecting information.
    Real learning happens when ideas are explained clearly, connected logically,
    and given the time they need to settle.
  </p>
  <p>
    My teaching focuses on fundamentals, clarity, and honest thinking.
    Whether working with mathematics, data analysis, or technology,
    I aim to guide learners toward confidence through understanding,
    not shortcuts or memorization.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="content-block">
  <h2>Data Science with Understanding</h2>
  <p>
    My work in data science is centered on understanding data before applying tools.
    Models and algorithms are only meaningful when the assumptions behind them
    are clearly understood.
  </p>
  <p>
    I emphasize structured thinking, careful analysis, and interpretation of results.
    This approach helps learners move beyond surface-level usage
    and develop skills that remain valid as tools and technologies change.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="content-block">
  <h2>Commitment to Growth</h2>
  <p>
    Learning is a long-term journey. It requires patience, perseverance,
    and the willingness to revisit fundamentals until they become solid.
  </p>
  <p>
    I bring this same dedication to my teaching and projects,
    believing that consistent effort and honest work always lead to meaningful results.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="content-block">
  <h2>Online Education Done Right</h2>
  <p>
    Online education is most effective when it preserves the discipline
    and depth of traditional learning while offering flexibility and focus.
    It should never reduce standards or oversimplify ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    I design online learning experiences that emphasize clarity,
    structured progression, and independent thinking,
    allowing learners to engage deeply without unnecessary distraction.
